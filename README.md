# RedfinScraper Example

This is an example I wrote up to assist someone who was trying to understand how to use _RedfinScraper_ by GitHub user **@ryansherby**.

You can find their code here: **https://github.com/ryansherby/RedfinScraper**

The project's Readme states that _RedfinScraper_ is:

_A scalable Python library that leverages Redfin's unofficial Stringray API to quickly scrape real estate data._

I based my example off a _test.py_ file located in the root folder of the main branch. Along the way, I added a few more print statements and scaled down the examples to just use the zip code database recommeneded in the _One-Time Setup_ section of the project's Readme. From the print statements, we can see that a **Panda Data Frame** is being used to store the scraped data.

Note: My examples only use the massive zip csv database as mentioned above, so they don't demonstrate how to use the _config.json_ file together with the scrape function.
